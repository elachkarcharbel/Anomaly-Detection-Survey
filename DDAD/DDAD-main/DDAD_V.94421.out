mkdir -p failed for path /Home/Users/celachkar/.config/matplotlib: [Errno 30] Read-only file system: '/Home/Users/celachkar/.config/matplotlib'
Matplotlib created a temporary cache directory at /tmp/jobscratch/94421/matplotlib-1zk6l0di because there was an issue with the default path (/Home/Users/celachkar/.config/matplotlib); it is highly recommended to set the MPLCONFIGDIR environment variable to a writable directory, in particular to speed up the import of Matplotlib and to better support multiprocessing.
